We are happy about contributions to A\+M\+I\+CI in any form (new functionality, documentation, bug reports, ...).

\subsubsection*{Making code changes}

When making code changes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check if you agree to release your contribution under the conditions provided in {\ttfamily L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+SE}
\item Start a new branch from {\ttfamily develop}
\item Implement your changes
\item Submit a pull request to the {\ttfamily develop} branch
\item Make sure your code is documented appropriately
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily mtoc/make\+Documentation.\+m} to check completeness of your documentation
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure your code is compatible with C++11, {\ttfamily gcc} and {\ttfamily clang}
\item when adding new functionality, please also provide test cases (see {\ttfamily tests/cpputest/})
\item Write meaningful commit messages
\item Run all tests to ensure nothing was broken
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily tests/cpputest/wrap\+Test\+Models.\+m} followed by CI tests {\ttfamily scripts/build\+All.\+sh \&\& scripts/run-\/cpputest.\+sh}
\item Run {\ttfamily tests/test\+Models.\+m}
\item Run {\ttfamily make python-\/tests} in {\ttfamily build}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When all tests are passing and you think your code is ready to merge, request a code review
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Adding/\+Updating tests}

To add new tests add a new corresponding python script (see, e.\+g., {\ttfamily tests/example\+\_\+dirac.\+py}) and add it to and run {\ttfamily tests/generate\+Test\+Configuration\+For\+Examples.\+sh} To update test results replace {\ttfamily tests/cpputest/expected\+Results.\+h5} by {\ttfamily tests/cpputest/write\+Results.\+h5.\+bak} \mbox{[}O\+N\+LY DO T\+H\+IS A\+F\+T\+ER T\+R\+I\+P\+LE C\+H\+E\+C\+K\+I\+NG C\+O\+R\+R\+E\+C\+T\+N\+E\+SS OF R\+E\+S\+U\+L\+TS\mbox{]} Before replacing the test results, confirm that only expected datasets have changed, e.\+g. using {\ttfamily h5diff -\/v -\/r 1e-\/8 tests/cpputest/expected\+Results.\+h5 tests/cpputest/write\+Results.\+h5.\+bak $\vert$ less}
