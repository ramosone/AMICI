{\bfseries{Q}}\+: My model fails to build.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Remove the corresponding model directory located in A\+M\+I\+C\+I/models/$\ast$yourmodelname$\ast$ and compile again.





{\bfseries{Q}}\+: It still does not compile.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: Make an \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/issues}{\texttt{ issue}} and we will have a look.





{\bfseries{Q}}\+: I get an out of memory error while compiling my model on a Windows machine.

{\bfseries{Q}}\+: The simulation/sensitivities I get are incorrect.

{\bfseries{A}}\+: There are some known issues, especially with adjoint sensitivities, events and D\+A\+Es. If your particular problem is not featured in the \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/issues}{\texttt{ issues}} list, please add it!
