\subsubsection*{Availability}

The sources for A\+M\+I\+CI are accessible as
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Source \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/tarball/master}{\texttt{ tarball}}
\item Source \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/zipball/master}{\texttt{ zip}}
\item G\+IT repository on \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI}{\texttt{ github}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Obtaining A\+M\+I\+CI via the G\+IT versioning system}

In order to always stay up-\/to-\/date with the latest A\+M\+I\+CI versions, simply pull it from our G\+IT repository and recompile it when a new release is available. For more information about G\+IT checkout their \href{http://git-scm.com/}{\texttt{ website}}

The G\+IT repository can currently be found at \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+I\+C\+B-\/\+D\+C\+M/\+A\+M\+I\+CI}} and a direct clone is possible via \begin{DoxyVerb}git clone https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI.git AMICI
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Installation}

If A\+M\+I\+CI was downloaded as a zip, it needs to be unpacked in a convenient directory. If A\+M\+I\+CI was obtained via cloning of the git repository, no further unpacking is necessary.

\paragraph*{Dependencies}

The M\+A\+T\+L\+AB interface only depends on the symbolic toolbox, which is needed for model compilation, but not simulation.

\subparagraph*{Symbolic Engine}

The M\+A\+T\+L\+AB interface requires the symbolic toolbox for model compilation. The symbolic toolbox is not required for model simulation.

\subparagraph*{Math Kernel Library (M\+KL)}

The python and C++ interfaces require a system installation of {\ttfamily B\+L\+AS}. A\+M\+I\+CI has been tested with various native and general purpose M\+KL implementations such as Accelerate, Intel M\+KL, cblas, openblas, atlas. The matlab interface uses the M\+A\+T\+L\+AB M\+KL, which requires no prior installation.

\subparagraph*{H\+D\+F5}

The python and C++ interfaces provide routines to read and write options and results in \href{https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/}{\texttt{ hdf5}} format. For the python interface, the installation of hdf5 is optional, but for the C++ interace it is required. H\+DF can be installed using package managers such as \href{https://brew.sh}{\texttt{ brew}} or \href{https://wiki.debian.org/Apt}{\texttt{ apt}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}brew install hdf5
\end{DoxyVerb}


or \begin{DoxyVerb}apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subparagraph*{S\+W\+IG}

The python interface requires \href{http://www.swig.org}{\texttt{ S\+W\+IG}}, which has to be installed by the user. Swig can be installed using package managers such as \href{https://brew.sh}{\texttt{ brew}} or \href{https://wiki.debian.org/Apt}{\texttt{ apt}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}brew install swig
\end{DoxyVerb}


or \begin{DoxyVerb}apt-get install swig3.0
\end{DoxyVerb}


We note here that some linux package managers may provide swig executables as {\ttfamily swig3.\+0}, but installation as {\ttfamily swig} is required. This can be fixed using, e.\+g., symbolic links\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mkdir -p ~/bin/ && ln -s $(which swig3.0) ~/bin/swig && export PATH=~/bin/:$PATH
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subparagraph*{python packages}

The python interface requires the python packages {\ttfamily pkgconfig} and {\ttfamily numpy} to be installed before A\+M\+I\+CI can be installed. These can be installed via {\ttfamily pip}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}pip3 install pkgconfig numpy
\end{DoxyVerb}


\paragraph*{M\+A\+T\+L\+AB}

To use A\+M\+I\+CI from M\+A\+T\+L\+AB, start M\+A\+T\+L\+AB and add the A\+M\+I\+C\+I/matlab direcory to the M\+A\+T\+L\+AB path. To add all toolbox directories to the M\+A\+T\+L\+AB path, execute the matlab script \begin{DoxyVerb}installAMICI.m
\end{DoxyVerb}


To store the installation for further M\+A\+T\+L\+AB session, the path can be saved via \begin{DoxyVerb}savepath
\end{DoxyVerb}


For the compilation of .mex files, M\+A\+T\+L\+AB needs to be configured with a working C compiler. The C compiler needs to be installed and configured via\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mex -setup c
\end{DoxyVerb}


For a list of supported compilers we refer to the mathworks documentation\+: \href{http://mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2018b/index.html}{\texttt{ mathworks.\+com}} Note that Microsoft Visual Studio compilers are currently not supported.

\paragraph*{python}

To use A\+M\+I\+CI from python, install the module and all other requirements using pip\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}pip3 install amici
\end{DoxyVerb}


You can now import it as python module\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}import amici
\end{DoxyVerb}


In case you only want to use the A\+M\+I\+CI Python package for generating model code for use with Matlab or C++ and don\textquotesingle{}t want to bothered with any unnecessary dependencies, you can run \begin{DoxyVerb}pip3 install --install-option --no-clibs
\end{DoxyVerb}


Note, however, that you will not be able to compile any model into a Python extension with this installation.

\subparagraph*{Anaconda}

To use an Anaconda installation of python, proceed as follows\+:

Since Anaconda provides own versions of some packages which might not work with amici (in particular the gcc compiler), create a minimal virtual environment via\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}conda create --name ENV_NAME pip python
\end{DoxyVerb}


Here, replace E\+N\+V\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME by some name for the environment. To activate the environment, do\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}source activate ENV_NAME
\end{DoxyVerb}


(and {\ttfamily conda deactivate} later to deactivate it again).

S\+W\+IG must be installed and available in your {\ttfamily P\+A\+TH}, and a C\+B\+L\+A\+S-\/compatible B\+L\+AS must be available. You can also use conda to install the latter locally, using\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}conda install -c conda-forge openblas
\end{DoxyVerb}


To install A\+M\+I\+CI, now do\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}pip install amici
\end{DoxyVerb}


The option {\ttfamily -\/-\/no-\/cache} may be helpful here to make sure the installation is done completely anew.

Now, you are ready to use A\+M\+I\+CI in the virtual environment.

\paragraph*{C++}

To use A\+M\+I\+CI from C++, run the

\begin{DoxyVerb}./scripts/buildSundials.sh
./scripts/buildSuitesparse.sh
./scripts/buildAmici.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}


script to compile amici libary. The static library file can then be linked from \begin{DoxyVerb}./build/libamici.a
\end{DoxyVerb}


In C\+Make-\/based packages, amici can be linked via \begin{DoxyVerb}find_package(Amici)
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Dependencies}

The M\+A\+T\+L\+AB interface requires the Mathworks Symbolic Toolbox for model generation via {\ttfamily amiwrap(...)}, but not for execution of precompiled models. Currently M\+A\+T\+L\+AB R2018a or newer is not supported (see \href{https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI/issues/307}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+I\+C\+B-\/\+D\+C\+M/\+A\+M\+I\+C\+I/issues/307}})

The python interface requires python 3.\+6 or newer and {\ttfamily cblas} library to be installed. Windows installations via pip are currently not supported, but users may try to install amici using the build scripts provided for the C++ interface (these will by default automatically install the python module).

The C++ interface requires {\ttfamily cmake} and {\ttfamily cblas} to be installed.

The tools S\+U\+N\+D\+I\+A\+LS and Suite\+Sparse shipped with A\+M\+I\+CI do {\bfseries{not}} require explicit installation.

A\+M\+I\+CI uses the following packages from S\+U\+N\+D\+I\+A\+LS\+:
